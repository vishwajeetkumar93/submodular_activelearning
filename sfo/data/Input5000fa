771- he added : the present generations and after us based on constant cultural constructions through film , serials and must
772- understand this important factor that resources are limited and valuable and attention should be paid for their consumption .
773- this economic expert reminded : the encouragement of people for using the correct pattern of consumption should be accompanied by the obliteration of this mentality that the pattern of consumption is not equivalent to economizing in spending .
774- he added : this pattern in addition to reducing the level of consumption , must be followed by the optimized use of the resources .
775- amirtash pointed out : if people water electricity and as much as they value money
776- and considered them like losing money the pattern of consumption would definitely change .
777- this economic expert by criticizing the gas rationing plan said : even though this plan was accompanied with some successes but it would have been better to attend to the correction in the pattern of consumption in the sector of fuel by the use of economic levers .
778- he declared : efforts for keeping the prices low by the government resulted that in such circumstances the level of consumption of goods in the country was increased and people practically got used to high consumption .
779- he added : meanwhile the person who should pay for the difference of the current and real price in the high consumption process of the people government and it through the budget .

783- also an economic expert said : considering that consumption pattern is not from the economy and our economy is also mainly dependent on oil revenues , therefore the consumption pattern of our country is constantly under the influence of currents and vacillations of oil .
784- seyed kamil tayebi declared : for this reason also the increase or reduction of oil revenues affects the consumer from different aspects and especially in problem generating situations puts some pressures on them .

789- he said : the cession of public companies is one of the basic pillars of these policies and it is not a secret to the economic experts that accounting and the place of this profession in the process of cession of public institutions is without reason .
790- salami said : further analysis of the dimensions of accounting role creation in the cession of companies will provide a significant help in the expediting and facilitation of this process and can respond to the existing criticism with regards to the domain of pricing of companies and the basic price of the stocks .

792- an expert of the investment market said : in case of continuity of the presence of quasi state , the market of investment will not be able to get out of the inert situation in the future and will still remain weak and in the monopoly of the quasi state group .
793- akbar mardani expressed : among the reasons for the inertia of the investment market is the non presence of people and the private sector and the ownership of the major shares of companies by the quasi state .

795- the reporter of irna by going to a number of real estate agencies in arak heard this sentence many times , while it was said to him many times to buy a residential unit , we ourselves will sell it for you a few months later several million toomans more than the current price .
796- acting in accordance with such recommendations though has brought easy profit to the purchasers and those who have pecuniary ability but in reality strongly stock speculation and brokerage during the last years and willingness for the purchasing and sale of housing has gradually replaced production and construction of houses .
797- such a situation resulted in the escalation of the number of demands in the housing sector and as a result the increase of its price and this matter has made things more and more difficult for the youth and individuals who housing .
798- today the subject of installation of cooperatives , provision of state lands and participation in construction is prominently being discussed in different circles and the recommendation for forming a cooperative and construction of housing is replaced with the recommendation for its purchasing and sale .
799- the deputy of construction affaires of central governorship said this regard : considering that the production of low cost housing is among the important programs of the ninth government , not in far future the price of housing will definitely be adjusted .
800- engineer " alireza noorbehesht " in a conversation with irna stated the necessary time for the construction of housing two years and added : with the cession of low cost housing units to the targeted stratums the problem of the housing sector will gradually decrease .
801- by reminding the " psychological reason " for the increase of the prices said : in the market there is a psychological discussion and a real discussion real point of view housing situation is not but some psychological pressures have increased the price .
802- he requested a change in the outlook of the people on housing and said : families who have the power of purchasing a residential unit should know that in arak housing is produced more than the real need and their economic maturity should not be influenced the psychological discussions of the market .
803- he considered support for the mass construction of housing of other government policies for eliminating the problem of housing and said : in this direction the land in question has been placed at the disposition of mass constructors and its price will be received after completion of construction .

805- with regards to other cities of the province he said : suitable land has been identified in many of the cities of the province and will be surrendered upon formation and presentation of housing cooperatives and the relative unions for the designated land .
806- as it can be understood from the explanations of those in charge at the central province people must make decisions by paying attention to their economic maturity so next two years forced to cavil some of " economic brains " as to why they have not guided them correctly .
807- because gradually until the next two years the government programs will be fruitful and the price of housing will be adjusted .
808- his holiness ayatollah khamenei the supreme leader of the islamic revolution in a meeting with the authorities of the system , the ambassadors of islamic countries and a group of stratums of people considered the auspicious feast of fetr suitable grounds for union and solidarity in national and the islamic world dimensions .
809- he indicated : if the elections are in such a way that political groups in a positive competition for serving people , are able to obtain their appropriate and adequate share , these elections will become a groundwork for the vivacity and progress of society .
810- his holiness ayatollah khamenie affirmed : the islamic republic of iran is standing on its positions in particular the necessity for the unity of muslims and the reason for the animosity of the arrogant with the iranian nation is due to this matter but this animosity has not had an effect until now and will not in the future either .
811- perhaps the temptation for the management of such a company is a desire of any politician and economic director , and perhaps even this desire has instigated some to wind up the clock for merging once again .
812- the main reason of the opponents to the merger , is the creation of a monopoly .
813- with regards to this avesta goudarzi , the professor of automobile in the science and industry faculty said : if apart from iran khodro and saipa we had another strong automobile manufacturing in the local market , the merger would appear more logical .
814- on the other hand merging is not necessarily the dissolving of one manufacturer in the other .
815- with regards to this hassan molatefi , expert in automobile industry says : the automobile industry of iran has fundamental problems and before the merger these problems which will become even more through expansion should be solved .
816- at the present a small factory in advanced countries operates more coherent and more organized iranian automobile factories .
817- he says : iran khodro and saipa a company compete will not remain .
818- of course if this merger is intended for globalization – which appears to be a very distant ideal – perhaps the iranian companies through useful work during the next few years may be able to saturate their regional markets .
819- after the beginning of the murmuring for the merger , everyone waited for the country ’ s automobile manufacturing directors to show a reaction , but it was not so and even the managing director of saipa with regards to the possibility of the merger , without expressing a specific opinion announced it only relative to one of the sub complex directors of saipa .
820- in iran also if at the present time frame until joining the world trade organization , a specific effort is not made for acquiring a competitive force in the automobile industry , this industry even within the borders of the country , will not have the force for competing with extra - national companies .
821- he says : the share of research and development costs in the basket of automobile costs is rather heavy and raises the price of the finished product a great deal for eliminating this problem , the merger of automobile manufacturers can be a solution .
822- but it was not after long that mehrabian the director of ministry of industries and mines said : for the merger of automobile manufactures we do not have a plan yet and i think before a merger certain policies which exist in parts of automobile manufacturing should be revised .
823- with the current situation and the existing patterns in the country , there is not the necessary preparedness for the merging of automobile manufacturers and no program has been envisaged for it and this discussion is brought up merely from a theoretical aspect .
824- on the other hand any of the merged automobile manufacturing companies , have had privileges with regards to the opposite party opposing party did not and efforts have been made for solving problems the opposing party by merging and the markets to be covered throughout the world in an appropriate manner .
825- but apart from all of these elements , the creation of a widespread monopoly in the local market is among the strongest reasons of the opponents .
826- they say when in the local market there is no third strong automobile manufacturer and imports are only limited to luxury automobiles , how can the half done competition of iran khodro and saipa transfer into a total monopoly .
827- the foreign policy – examination of iran ’ s nuclear file in means that this file has returned to its natural channel since it is among the duties of the agency to revert these issues to within itself .
828- he affirmed : we also believe that there are many questions and concerns with regards to the nuclear activity of other countries that are necessary for the agency to attend to and of course until now such a matter has not occurred .
829- the minister of foreign affaires of the islamic republic of iran continued , when we announce iran ’ s nuclear file is closed it means that this matter has returned to its normal process which is actually the agency .
830- motaki ’ s response : iran ’ s nuclear file had two limits and boundaries from the beginning , the first was based on cooperation and the second was based on encountering and the option of iran has always been cooperation and resolution of this matter through discussion and it is always endeavoring towards this .
831- he added : the u.s. is fighting against the opinion public which is accusing washington of intervention in the middle east ’ s regional affairs especially iraq given these circumstances the united states does not have the conditions for entering into another war en
832- the world history has witnessed various problems of racism and its ideological and practical aspects , but it has not seen more racist and dangerous than the ideas and thoughts of zionism .
833- in england and after that in the united states the same matter occurred .
834- the tenacious opposition of american jews was destroyed when the governing board of this country accepted the zionism plan as a part of its strategic planning .
835- this way zionists acquired the necessary legitimacy .
836- the echoes of this category still exist in the thoughts of zionism and israel , because the zionist propagandists do not stop talking about the western democracy unit in the middle east and the stretching of european borders to asia and africa .
837- in israel there are many who consider themselves as the torchbearers of the western civilization in the middle east and consider the arabs the representatives of the backward east .
838- for example aba eban " in explaining israel says : israel is located in the middle east but .
839- the general structural principles of israeli policy which from birth the strategic alliance with the united states , are an indictor of this viewpoint .
840- " hana arent " female jewish author who before the announcement for the formation of the zionist government , had predicted many of its characteristics , emphasized that zionism by introducing itself as a national movement sold itself from the very beginning .
841- because the slogan of the jewish government in reality was that intend to use ethnicity cover and to present themselves as strategic influence dominion of each of the superpowers ( who the price .
842- he then added : " the united states still owes us seventy billion dollars .
843- wiseman after explaining his viewpoint clarifies that the english colonialism with the approval of the zionist organization has trusted a group which is ready to support a large portion of the material responsibilities of colonialism .
844- " if it is revealed that the costs for the english guardianship will be higher then one can train and equip the jewish colonialists .
845- the jewish nation due to special and unique from the very beginning was distinguishing itself from other nations , religions and races and allowed itself a specific superiority in comparison to others .
846- the zionist leaders in order to equip and the characters of the usurping government of israel in view of dominating all occupied territories by implementing the plan of predilection of the jewish nation , accomplished their domineering interests .
847- the racist zionist regime also revealed its superiority outlook within the israeli society .
848- from their viewpoint the jews due to belonging nation and religion are not at the same level but there are differences between them .
849- once when the eastern jews stood in protest " ben gourion " the then prime minister of israel told them : " your prophet was kept in the sinai desert forty years but i will keep you in this situation a few years only .
850- also the eastern jews were sent to the front lines of the war more than others .
851- in the political department also most of the key positions were in the hands of western jews .
852- in a general glance at the social and political composition of the israeli regime we realize that prime ministry positions , ministry , the parliamentary representatives were monopolized by the european jews and the asian and african jews due to the racism of this regime are subject to a great deal of disdain .
853- the nature of the zionist regime is the same racist zionism nature .
854- professor " roger garoudi " the french muslim thinker believes that racism is considered the prologue and suitable grounds for the expansionist policy of the zionist regime .
855- zionists consider themselves as a chosen nation and apart from other nations and people , and believe that other nations should be at their service .
856- in the same perspective the inhuman policy of the zionist regime with regards to the rights of others and their deprivation from political , economic and social rights , and exploitation of the occupied territories , justified .
857- racism of zionism
858- is a coordinated system which inspires the lawmakers and statesmen of israel .
859- this racism , from that time was considered the plan of hertzel .
860- racism had remarkable in the occupied territories that the united nations , in $year , a resolution called zionism a type of racism .
861- therefore the racist regime of israel with this ideology made the arabs residing in the palestinian territory wanderers .
862- in reality the racist outlook forms one of the basis and mind sets of zionism in the formation , stabilization and durability of this illegal creation in the region .
863- for years the regime occupying ghods through its racist thoughts has made the muslim palestinians , while even some of the palestinian citizens who have israeli nationality are also treated as a third class citizen .
864- the representatives of the islamic majlis have also obliged the government to concede the shares of companies transferable in such a way that it does not cause an increase or continuation of ownership of the government management of companies eligible for concession .
865- the secretariat of the council will be settled in the privatization organization and the council is required to have a speaker and the speaker is obliged to provide timely , clear and comprehensive information .
866- he said : the islamic revolution is full of foundations and values therefore our duty is to defend these ideals and values of the revolution .
867- commander jaafari by stating that a goal is sufficient for the missions and activities of our organization said : a goal which has been traced by the supreme leader for the corps so that we may be able to accomplish our mission correctly .
868- because this goal and anticipated guidelines are very determining for us and we should pay special attention to them .
869- the leader of the corps by referring to various enemy threats from the beginning of the islamic revolution said : after the revolution we were faced with a security threat .
870- we left behind the period of the holy defense for the military threat and in the interval after the war we are faced with cultural - political and social threats and therefore from the beginning of this stage the leader of the revolution warned against the subject of cultural attack .
871- therefore he ordered that the corps be a flexible organization so they may be able to enter into action correctly against political , social and security threats of the enemies .
872- by stating that the corps in order to accomplish this guideline requires an organization in different fields , he added : we have to our structure based on the surrounding conditions or existing threats so just as the leadership ordered be able to enter into action on time with flexibility .
873- hence the mission the corps is fight against internal threats and afterwards in case of a foreign military threat the corps will hasten to help the army .
874- he said : thank god until today the corps in the assigned missions has been able to carefully enter into action and to leave behind the hard passes .
875- commander jaafari also said : today all the threats reveal themselves through a variety of functions .
876- political , security and military threats through new approaches this matter shows that the threats against the revolution have become more complex and widespread than the past so we do not have the right to sit still .
877- commander jaafari said : since our revolution is a lively and dynamic revolution and every day it is faced with different threats of the enemy how can we fight the enemy through a type of a stereotypical training and then claim readiness .
878- he referred to the new strategy of the corps and said : the new strategy which the corps has is that all the defined works and missions are not placed as priority .
879- after strategic studies the type of activities in the organizations must be examined and the most important works be placed in priority .

883- even though due to a great deal of work occupation i may not be able to spend full time in the basij headquarters but commander mir ahmadi who was the replacement of commander hejazi in resistance will remain in his position and will also help me this .
884- major general jaafari said at the end : my outlook on basij is the same outlook that has been explained by the supreme leader and i hope to be able to perform my duties in this field correctly .

925- the office of amal movement also in this report addressing the muslims warned against the future of palestine and requested an islamic determination for the resolution of the palestinian issue .
926- an extract from the text of this report follows
927- these conspiracies will take place with the intention of obtaining military and security power by this regime .
928- israel by making the arab and islamic people busy internal clashes and local and tribal differences , has drawn a louver wall between muslims and the holy and determining matters of palestine .
929- at this stage the role of imam mousa sadr as a muslim leader , thinker intellectual , major reformist and an indefatigable mujahid who for the first time actualized the jihad resistance plan shows itself .
930- after the occupation of palestine by israel , he sensed the danger of presence of this regime for lebanon tried the palestine issue appear as a national apprehension for all the muslims of the world and even an international and human issue .
931- imam mousa sadr by organizing the lebanese resistance groups under the title of amal movement put the foundation for the first stone of the edifice of the resistance plan against the zionist enemy .
932- in our resistance culture , qods is the first qibla and the third noble sanctuary .
933- there is the heart of the movement and the center of gravity of our mobility .
934- israel for about a quarter of a century was present in the lands of the year $year and the southern borders of lebanon but this was only a physical presence and any commercial , cultural visual dealings and
935- with lebanon .
936- the victory of the islamic revolution of iran with the leadership of imam khomeini ( peace be upon him ) became a pattern for all the palestinian and lebanese mujaheddin and combatants .
937- as imam khomeini said : israel is a cancer tumor and should be eradicated .
938- while most arabic and muslim governments are lying in the protecting bosom of this occupying enemy , imam khomeini presented the cry for the accomplishment of the administration of a nation who was tyrannized , its territory usurped and its children wandered out of their homeland .
939- imam khomeini by supporting the palestinian nation considered their issue part of priorities and constantly emphasized on the restitution of the rights of this oppressed nation and their defense .

943- these operations are being carried out under the bab elmegharbeh , the western door of , and threatens the al - aqsa mosque and ghabeh alsakhreh .
944- israel carries out these actions for covering up the main palestinian issue and wants to make the world accept that palestinians themselves cannot take up the rein of their affairs in hand .
945- they arrogantly announce that they will prevent the presence of those praying in the al - aqsa mosque and in continuation talk about their long term programs based on the construction of haykal soleyman temple which the jewish believe once upon a time existed at the current site of the al - aqsa mosque .
946- the actions of occupying forces under the bab elmegharbeh which is located on the west side of the mosque and is known as bab alnabi , is in reality the continuity of excavation and devastation operations which started in $year with the destruction of the village of elmegharebeh , a village at the border of the shiny wall .

2277- of course each of these persons consider fairness and commitment to expertise also other factors effective in the price of oil .
2278- if we look at the factors affecting the price without taking sides and with regard to the price changes in the new period of the oil market and unprecedented and historical prices we observe factors .
2279- the first factor and the most important cause is the matching of production and consumption of oil in the world .
2280- malthus was of the belief that considering the rate of growth of the population , the production of foodstuffs could not respond to mankind ’ s food requirements and the world is subject to crises and wars for the possession of food resources .
2281- in this case also technology will in fact assist the increase in the production capacity and the recovery of oil resources which are today considered to be lost .
2282- this matter is a real and foreseeable possibility but until such time that appropriate technology for such an event is obtained and this idea is put into practice the conditions for the parity of production and consumption exist and in facing that the market has no solution other than increasing price .
2283- the other important and effective factor which plays a role in increasing the price in recent years and is also under the influence of the stock market , is the reduction in the value of the dollar by the american government which has pursued in recent years .
2284- the estimates produced indicate every percentage reduction in the value of the dollar , an increase in the price of oil follows by the same amount .
2285- each of these factors depending on market conditions have a fundamental and secondary role in the market .
2286- in recent years , contrary to the past when the change in the season produced an increase or reduction in demand and hence an increase or reduction in price , the tendency for seasonal increase and has also occurred .
2287- these policies reduce the destructive effects of oil inflation upon the production of goods .
2288- the role of imported oil and energy in these countries has reduced and these countries ’ oil companies have oil production .
2289- this increase however has not reduced in the direct consumption of oil products like gasoline and causes consumers ’ dissatisfaction .
2290- the reduction of price in this sector does not have an economic solution , but for reducing the effects of dissatisfaction in public opinion a political solution exists which is to accuse opec of being the agent for the increase in price .
2291- it is natural for political individuals in consuming countries and even experts with political tendencies opinion and stances to link the increase in the price of oil to opec as the essential factor in the increase in price .
2292- these statements are in fact a denial of reality in order to reduce the pressure of public opinion upon governments in consuming countries .
2293- the taking of a political position that results in opec being presented as the principal factor in the problems of the people in some countries doubtless affects opec ’ s decision making .
2294- the members of opec do not wish to be perceived in world public opinion as the cause of difficulties and for the same reason they make an effort to change this depiction by the positions they take in meetings of opec .
2295- the result of every opec meeting which must be ratified by a vote all members is clarified at the end of every conference .
2296- the reason for this matter is that one dissenting party can block the ratification of any proposal that is put forward in this meeting .
2297- despite the executive structure of opec and the equality of the countries ’ votes , the members of opec each have a particular weight and status .
2298- this status above all arises from their production ability .
2299- the country which has the most production ability enjoys the power to influence the decision of opec ministers .
2300- in the last meeting – that was the one hundred and forty fifth ordinary meeting of opec – the arabia ’ s minister for oil chose to keep silent at the airport when he arrived in vienna .
2301- this was in circumstances in which the majority of the members of opec announced on arrival at vienna that this organization ’ s oil production would not change .
2302- this position has been imposed upon that country ’ s representative since some timeago and with regard to the importance of this organization .
2303- the reason for this is that if he took any position before the meeting regarding opec ’ s decision this position would be construed the result of the conference and by an instant effect on the market , would influence the decision of the members present at the conference .
2304- thus for some time the oil minister of arabia has opted for a policy of silence regarding the oil market .
2305- this incorrect picture regardless of the principal influencing factors in the market – the explanation and description of which are very complex – causes opec decisions show their lack of basis .
2306- the decision of opec at the recent meeting for an increase in production with a one month delay while rejecting reluctance for an increase in production showed that the market does not determine the price by the decisions of this organization .
2307- opec does not as the past have the role as the agent determining the price in the oil market and only strives to pursue the preservation of interests in a market with several masters .
2308- on the basis of the law of usury - free banking , investment term deposits for the use of which the bank is the agent may be employed strictly for the profit making matters anticipated in the law and its relevant regulations .
2309- in continuation of this letter the central bank pointed out : participation in the capital of companies – by means of legal participation or direct investment – on the basis of the existing regulations is only permitted when the result of the review and evaluation of participation indicates the profitability of the plan .
2310- the head of the planning , budget and accounts commission of the islamic consultative assembly said : the system of banking without usury benefits from comprehensive laws and principles but what has caused its inefficiency in the banking structure of the country is the non - implementation of its laws by the relevant organs .

2536- the director general of central bank added : because of this reason we announced to the islamic economy organization that we could not issue the license for establishing gharz - al - hasaneh bank in this way ; because the name of gharz - al - hasaneh refers to the content not to have only a name of a bank .

2554- therefore close , extensive and firm relations between two civilized countries are inevitable .
2555- even the poet ’ s commitment to art for art itself is a kind of partiality .
2556- the partiality to the language physics and ignoring the external contextual references which itself is considered a kind of declaring position against the references .
2557- and the revolution verse too .
2558- the constitutional verse leads to nima and the revolution verse also to the bound religious verse with today ’ s political and social sense .
2559- partial verse is an extravert verse and its ego a plural ego .
2560- extraversion of this verse appears because of the extent and comprehensiveness of great political and social events and subduing of the poet against expressive appetency and journalistic space and the power of common addressee and it often changes the work to a merely meaning conveyer medium .
2561- i am going because karbala called me now.
2562- but there are some poets that even in this situation do not forget effort for establishing a kind of balance between form and content .
2563- although gheysar aminpour often is subdued the powerful circulation partial verse he mostly achieves remarkable successes for reaching that balance .
2564- then he tries establish place a balance between form and content and between familiar poetic tradition and innovative and unfamiliar poetic heresies in the frontispiece of his work and passes the success borders .
2565- his extensive studies in the field of tradition and innovation and their complex relation which has been outcropped in his very valuable book the tradition and innovation in the contemporary verse , have taken his under arms in this difficult and long way .
2566- thus he never fell in the trap of extravagant and radical innovative circulations of recent two or three decades of iran ’ s verse and also no one could call his verse traditional or radical .
2567- in other words the poetic movement and evolution of gheysar aminpour has been done from the primary extravert plural ego to the final introverted distinguished personal ego very reasonably , cautiously and patiently that has immunized his verse from any soft accepted poetic deviation of his time .
2568- it is interesting that this movement and evolution in his all beloved figures which named before come into view with an equal ratio .
2569- where is it ? / how many times / the tatters pockets turn up side down : / a few folded tickets / a few old and crumpled money notes / a few black coins / a shopping list / a shopping list of the internal goods .
2570- an inevitable day that all poets will experience but only some of them will come near the peak which he reached .
2571- however most of them will not have his great and wonderful humility and for this reason they will never experience acceptability aminpour .
2572- gheysar found comfort in his birthplace the soil is still waiting for gheysar in the memory of persian poetry dying youth i don ’ t know where you are or who you are

2945- now it is possible that the respected reader of these lines criticizes the author that georgia ’ s government is " dictatorship and not " polyarchy and in american polyarchy people ’ s situation is better .
2946- so let ’ s have a brief look at a country that has experienced its own american democratic revolution " before robinson writing his book and he has stamped it with polyarchy .
2947- of course the government of america calls this country , meaning philippines as " the oldest democracy in south east asia .
2948- the first part of the scenario is completely the same .
2949- after wide range monkey business the name of democracy and human rights , america succeeded in completely restraining and neutralizing people ’ s anti - marcos movement known as " people power ( people ’ s power )
2950- arroyo has joined the old wealthy people of the country .

2953- guardian writes : " at this point in time the philippines is one of the deadliest locations in the world for journalists .
2954- on the verge of the first people ’ s uprising
2955- we see that polyarchy and dictatorship are very close to each other and completely far from " people ’ s democracy .
2956- however the most important distinction between polyarchy and dictatorship and what causes the governments of georgia and the philippines to be named polyarchy , is the existence of elections .
2957- in the first glance it seems that contrary to dictatorship in polyarchy people have a kind of right to elect and by voting in periodical elections they breathe a bit .
2958- however investigation of the nature of elections in polyarchy shows that this breathing is very restricted and controlled .
2959- it is nothing more than a feeling and imagination .
2960- in robinson ’ s book it is stated : " polyarchy does not only restrict people ’ s presence in democratic decision making to vote at elections but in the matter of elections it only relies on form .
2961- this is while the other classes of society do not benefit from such opportunities and possibilities .
2962- in such situations , deceptive polyarchic elections , that from frame and appearance point of view seem acceptable but from content point of view are not free and fair at all , do a service to elite classes and their foreign supporters which is beyond the power of dictatorship .
2963- robinson believes that generally " while dictatorship protects the government of elite classes ( from people ’ s supervision and interference ) however it does not grant legitimacy to it , polyarchy does both actions .
2964- he specifies " the role of polyarchy , as a particular type of elite classes ’ government , is granting legitimacy to the existing inequalities in society and in comparison to a dictatorship government performs this duty more effectively .
2965- but the point is that this very apparent and artificial legitimacy and same feeling of restricted breathing that this deficient election brings leads to polyarchy as the tool of dominance and exploitation , having a longer life than dictatorship .
2966- without doubt this is the most important attraction of polyarchy for america and its allies it is really necessary that people of the countries that are targeted by america ’ s publicity attack with freedom and democracy motto keep this characteristic of polyarchy in mind .
2967- so should americans who with a lot of skill in the name of democracy blocks its way such a big obstacle be congratulated ? not at all .
2968- spilled bloods and tears of hungry children do not give such permission .
2969- instead of that in targeted countries this propaganda phenomenon must be exposed and neutralized by giving precise and extensive information .
2970- the above matter only a nook of the realities about america ’ s " promotion of democracy project but unfortunately " in the name of democracy program did not have slightest mention about any of these issues .
2971- the most generous judgment that can be presented about this program is that its makers in eagerness to prove the affiliation of the three arrested iranians and their colleagues with america , completely forgot the main issue meaning revelation of america ’ s policy and evil intentions of that country .
2972- as a result they drew a positive picture of america and in a word in their haste to have the brew they fell into pot .
2973- unfortunately it seems that in our country in the field of propaganda and communicating about america ’ s claim for promotion of democracy that might be the enemy ’ s most deliberate and dangerous deception , the number of these negligences and falls into the pot tend to increase .
2974- in the current discussion the most important noticeable issue is this lack of correct understanding within some classes of society america ’ s and its allies real intention in regard to countries such as iran can turn into one of the country ’ s major complicated and very dangerous issues .
2975- professor noam chomsky a prominent american intellectual and lecturer of m i t university whom new york times has named the most important contemporary american intellectual .

2977- another pillar of chomsky ’ s fame is numerous works that he has written in critique of america ’ s political system and that country ’ s foreign policy .

2979- mrs esfandiari said that the budget for " woodrow wilson centre that she is the director of its middle east program is funded by the congress of america .

2985- generally in sociology and political science elite is attributed a minority because of enjoying special social or financial or professional privileges etc hold a higher position compared to other people of society .
2986- hence , for instance , a member of a wealthy and influential family who does not possess qualifications , skill , or considerable capability is also considered as " elite of the society .

3867- explaining why some fatah leaders detained in gaza sami abuzohari one of the leaders of hamas that they try to destabilize gaza .
3868- to this purpose considering a critical point of political history of the islamic revolution ( the justice - based ninth administration ) this text investigates realism and idealism in this era.
3869- in the understanding of realist politicians on politics , national power and national interests are considered two important and vital principles .
3870- according to this mindset a wise player is the one that continuously attempts to access and elevate his materialistic and spiritual interests .
3871- meaning that to protect territorial integrity , resources and income - producing sources as well as to defend values and common beliefs are among the strategic goals of every political unit .
3872- here power and interests go hand - in - hand and for realist politicians , practicing political behaviors is affected by their realistic understanding of the international community .
3873- according to realists reaching security and stability in the field of foreign policy would not be possible unless a professional military force as well as efficient and equipped resource equipment play a role as the supporter of foreign policy and diplomatic organization .
3874- and even some of the followers of this theory believe power can play a more effective role than economic ability .
3875- hans j. morgenta a staunch supporter of realism believes that in the behaviors of governments common ethics and abstract concepts is fruitless and basically ethics don'ts have no place in the relationship between governments .
3876- according to this opinion until the government is unable to establish security efforts on political development expanding civic and political freedoms would reach nowhere .
3877- naturally governments cannot rely on any government or international organization for their survival .
3878- also according to them public opinion is not important us , it is important that in any case they should fear us .
3879- idealists accuse the school of realism of regressiveness , pessimism towards human nature and , egotism and selfishness .
3880- idealists politics " the art of a good government while the realists consider politics " the art of the possible .
3881- for idealists justice , ethics , abiding the established rights and human rights are desirable in any condition and they consider politics and power deviation from high humane and ethical principles .
3882- idealists consider the application of force as illegitimate and indecent and regard use of force and war the weapon of virtueless rulers .
3883- therefore it is necessary it considers the security of other countries its own security , and aggression to the security sanctuary of other countries for losing its own security .
3884- in the current conditions , in opposition to the imaginary society of idealists a picture of which was given above , no country would accept compromise and deal on its national interests and would not tie its political and national destiny to risky destinies of other governments .
3885- by investigating views and thoughts of schools of realism and idealism it would be clear that both views have gone to extremes .
3886- a politician without ethics , ideals and a world view is as unsuccessful as a utopian idealist who shows indifference towards current realities of the world .
3887- the critical point in investigating the quality of the foreign policy and understanding orientation , is paying attention to the type of domestic policy designed by government .
3888- because domestic and foreign policy very close and have goals , thinkers of international relations consider foreign policy the continuation of domestic policy outside .
3889- therefore having access to policies adopted by a government inside is a sure way to demonstrate and identify the idealism or realism of that political unit in the international environment .
3890- by investigating and evaluating the ninth administration in the political scene it can be claimed with assurance that the administration of dr. ahmadinejad has realism and idealism in its agenda .
3891- what we call realistic idealism .
3892- they may also accept that government is truly undesirable , but insist that government is a necessary evil the same way an extensive surgery operation is a necessary evil for improving a patient .
3893- this presentation of familiar reasoning could be found in an excellent fashion in the ideas of thomas hobbs .
3894- his idea is that government , which is defined as the exclusive power of legitimate compulsion , is necessary so to avoid a war of all against all , implement justice and protect the innocent and vulnerable .
3895- when this situation arises , the productive exclusivity of the government over the forces of violence worsens the circumstances .
3896- then the question the anarchists is whether the creation and maintenance of a social foundation with the possibility of such destructive diversion is .
3897- the internet has two evident characteristics : internationalism ( internationalism ) and populism ( populism ) .
3898- the internationalism of the internet is not simply limited to fact that the internet makes it possible people of various nations to communicate , since other human apparatus and activities do this .
3899- the point here is that browsing the internet is completely indifferent toward national borders people who are strangers in network are linked mutual interest to their nationality .
3900- from this point of view the internet is positioned in a severe opposition to what call civil society , meaning a society the joining of people alien or bringing unity to them is within a political arena .
3901- it is for this reason that an anarchist may welcome the internet .
3902- the second characteristic of the internet is its populism .
3903- in this regard we must bear in mind that this populism is not at a superficial level but rather at a profound level .
3904- in the present circumstances there is no specific eligibility for browsing topics on the network and more importantly participating in it and there is no actual censorship to hinder the participation of people in the absence of these credentials .
3905- only censorship governments such as the government of singapore or corporations which make possible the accessing of network has been proposed for preventing access to indecent sites they have a completely different intention .
3906- " why should he fear when has he depreciated by death and fears not .
3907- seyyed mohammad khamenei added will of trust is one of the manifestations of the attention of islam to reflection and scheduling for each person in one 's personal and social affairs for after death and the arranging of training for children and the managing of the affairs of the survivors .
3908- not everyone has allergies .
3909- some people propensity to being afflicted with this complication ( one or both parents have allergies and some develop it in response to circumstances .
3910- theory known as the hygiene theory states that allergy is the price we pay in lieu of maintaining ourselves and our children against pathogenic germs by using cleaning materials and antibiotics
3911- the point is that not being in contact with contamination , dust and some infections of the early years of childhood later makes the immune system much more sensitive to these factors .
3912- as an example , research conducted in europe has realized the fact that children who are in constant contact with animals and stables less afflicted with hay fever than those children who do not live in villages and farms .
3913- the museum of nature and wildlife of and tehran zoo were the hosts of the first festival of protecting the iranian panther .
3914- government and non - government organizations had educational programs such as showing films , the distribution of brochures and posters , giving talks to the public about the panther , training games , conducting a painting competition , and monologues on the topic of the panther at the end the statement of this day was recited .
3915- you must ask yourself this question , maybe for the same reason they rejected walk the line later this film .
3916- of course there were similarities between these two films and both of them took place in the old atmosphere of los angeles and new york .
3917- the studios were afraid of johnny cash and the story of his life this time they were not interested in a western story and believed that the presence of popular movie stars as western heroes will not be attractive .
3918- of course their problem is not simply limited to my films . almost every movie that was released in the fall of the previous years and had a historic plot , had the same problems these days studios do not respond to real filmmaking .
3919- they were not necessarily scared of this film they rather sought to distance themselves from the western genre .

4469- the evaporation of sweat the skin heat and causes the body .
4470- by glancing at history , it could be observed that until a few decades ago , politicians and legislators were not at all worried about the consequences of domestic violence and looked at this phenomenon judiciary and criminological .
4471- if violence was observed or proven everyone would think of police , court , judge and prison .
4472- nobody thought of the social harms and complications of this phenomenon in terms of societal and individual health .
4473- health care systems did not even have the competence except to respond to questions raised by the judicial system .
4474- until finally in order to prevent violence especially the hushed violence in the family sphere health care personnel meaning doctors and nurses , were asked to report suspicious cases of violence to police .
4475- since then the role of the medical society gradually surpassed the limits of caring for the victims of violence .
4476- meanwhile , about a month ago world health organization published its third report on the worldwide movement for preventing violence .
4477- of course perhaps more important is that millions of people survive non - fatal violence but never again experience a normal life .
4478- disability and injury that results from it are irretrievable and cannot escape it until the end of life .
4479- depression , addiction to various types of narcotic substances or street pills and sexual problems are some of other abnormalities which ruin the lives of these victims of violence .
4480- on the other hand at times these individual problems lead to social anomalies .
4481- these discussions are philosophical metaphysical , social , cultural and even historical .
4482- no i do not have such a belief at all .
4483- sometimes we a practical view and want to obtain tangible results .
4484- in that case yes , there are some justifications for these definitions .
4485- but from a fundamental point of view , one cannot overlook these discussions .
4486- yes , i also agree .
4487- but the discussion is not that simple this cloning and the likes of it in reality an interconnectable and evolutionary view toward science .
4488- if we pay attention to the metaphysical and historic - cultural principles of science in the same prevailing views which do not take the softwaric dimensions into account we could enter the scene more successfully and more productively .
4489- of course an extremely delicate discussion .
4490- look at the scientific epistemologies you have vienna circle " school which is the same as inductive science you also have the nihilism of " karl popper , in addition the research program " lacatush and you are immediately faced with cohen 's " paradigmatic view .
4491- now the question is what should we do with these topics ? of course i don't believe that since they have reached this conclusion , we also say what we do with this argument
4492- so one cannot separate the field of natural sciences from unnatural science .
4493- based on what logic we allow ourselves to separate natural science from humanities ? this is a particular logic which we may not want to follow .
4494- under what basis do you separate these issues from one another , especially at a time when epistemologies must be coherent ?
4495- i talked about the connection .
4496- connection does not mean the reduction of one to another .
4497- i am looking for a linear and coherent epistemology and i say one thing in this world connects knowledge of experience knowledge of observation and the knowledge of revelation .
4498- but this does not mean that " a sensual does the work of " intellectual knowledge or knowledge of intuition does the work of sensual knowledge .
4499- of course we cannot overlook their relations .
4500- in this sense , a linear and coherent epistemology manifests .
4501- since the universe is woven together one cannot separate practical wisdom from theoretical wisdom or the theoretical arena the evaluative arena the normative arena , and .
4502- they are all connected to one another , but they cannot be reduced together .
4503- so making a reference this relation may be related to " the subject , cannot cause for an absolute separation between natural and human sciences .
4504- this separation is not acceptable .
4505- of course i emphasize this fact does not mean that the topic of human science is the same as natural science .
4506- the subject of " relations was brought up , since it is indisputable that the subjects of humanities are more complex .
4507- the topics of natural science have a " simple harmonics , but the human sciences take advantage of " multiple harmonics .
4508- this argument has taken hold in study of methods whose studying of natural sciences phenomena we have the " acquainted doer , but the " acquainted subject is not a pivotal concept .
4509- but in the human sciences both the acquainted doer and the acquainted subject are pivotal .
4510- therefore in the argument of softwaric aspects , there has been interest toward natural sciences and maybe the main interest of natural science .
4511- it appears some friends , their issues and interests emanate from natural science .
4512- of course i had an objection to your question and the hidden answer in your question , but pay attention that the nature of science is such that one cannot separate the sciences with ease and consider softwaric aspects only applicable to human sciences .
4513- so by taking into consideration the relation of sciences , despite their differences , we can freely address the topics of epistemology and sociology and not be concerned about applicability .
4514- very well ! we talk specifically about human sciences and sociology .
4515- in the arena of sociology and philosophy , our knowledge is undoubtedly western .
4516- for example if we were to talk about urban sociology , we refer to " mcluhan and arguments " tonis and " max weber . if we were to talk about the philosophy of science or we must address karl popper and " shliar makker .
4517- it is in this manner that one could discuss types and sorts of sociologies and could no longer say the concept of urban sociology revolves around " city and its methods , are objective and positivistic .
